# Streamy Core Domain Structural Architecture
## Advanced Object‑Oriented System Entity Specifications

This structural document acts as the definitive blueprint for the Streamy runtime system.
It establishes core hierarchies, lifecycle coupling, and cardinality rules, dictating how object models must inherit attributes and clear space allocations out of memory.

### 1. Complex System Relationships Analysis

### 2. Comprehensive Production Class Diagram
The advanced structural design schematic below details all inheritance, composition, and aggregation parameters for the Streamy domain engine:
